					<div id="Private" class="tabcontent">
						<p>Hello, my name is Anthony Jasper and I’m a 31 year old male from an area known as Kent, England. I’ve been self-learning web development and design for the last 4 years now.
						<br><br>
						I started with a dream of entering the game development scene. I went to University for 3 years studying game design and software engineering, being awarded with the degree ‘bachelor of engineering’ with a second class honours 1st division. After graduating, I spent the next year looking to get a foot into the door but was turned away everytime. So I decided to get in contact with a few friends from college and we started self-teaching ourselves on App Development using Unity.
						<br><br>
						6 months later we had published a simple card matching game on the google store that featured a local highscore, card cover customisation and difficulty selectors. It did okay on the store, but with it being a simple game, it didn’t take off. The App development didn’t last for much longer after that. One of the developers suggested we move onto web development since he had some experience in creating websites.
						<br><br>
						This is where we ended up creating Cloudyne Limited and the start of my adventure into becoming a frontend web developer & designer.</p>

								<h2>Analyzing Websites</h2>
								<p>When surfing the web or looking for some inspiration, I will occasionally open the developer tools and inspect the code. Doing so allows me to view how other developers were able to achieve the result of a certain feature. I will usually compare it to how I would go about creating the feature or try to understand why the developer took the path they did. This then allows me to get a better understanding and possibly learn something new.</p>
							</div>
	
							<div>
								<h2>Creating and Experimenting with Website Animations</h2>
								<p>Adding animations to a website makes it more appealing and interactive for the user when they visit the website. Different animation styles, determine how you want the information to be presented to the user, e.g. flashing animation draws the users attention, whereas sliding animations sets a hierarchy between two elements. Experimenting with animations allow me to create multiple layers and present information in different but exciting ways.</p>

						<h2>Director-Developer-Designer</h2>
						<span class="sec-sub">Cloudyne Limited</span>
						<p>As the director of Cloudyne I would look at how to progress the business, such as overseeing the performance of the business, maintaining the finance department, proposing different forms of strategy and technology upgrades. As for the frontend designer side, I was responsible for working with the clients during the requirements and design phase, managing fonts, images, CSS, HTML, JQuery and CMS plugins etc. When the site was finished I would also manage their hosting and any support changes they wished to make.</p>

						<h2>Developer & Designer</h2>
						<span class="sec-sub">Music Streaming</span>
						<p>Cloudyne was approached by a client who was interested in developing a music streaming app. Both parties would form under a separate company and have equal shares. The approaching party was responsible for securing funding and company management, whilst Cloudyne were responsible for designing and developing the app whilst maintaining it after publication. However, after 1 year, the approaching party was unable to secure the rest of the funding needed to complete the project so it eventually collapsed.</p>

						<p>A friend and I wanted to put our skills to the test to see what we were capable of doing. We both decided to create a game in the Unity Engine due to our combined skills within the Engine and JavaScript language. The game became a children's memory game that requires the player to flip over cards and match the images shown. The game was released onto Google Play Store 6 months after development started.</p>

					<p>Cloudyne was a business that focused on providing small businesses with up-to-date websites with the latest trends. Websites can be expensive and can come as a shock to some people, so we provided them with reasonable prices for the size of their business. Alongside websites, Cloudyne offered domain and hosting with no increased recurring pricing. I set this business up to continue my personal development and a way for people to promote their business without having to pay a fortune for a bare minimum, basic looking websites.</p>

						<h2>Minecraft Idle Game</h2>
						<span>www.idle.anthonyjasper.co.uk</span>			
						<div class="design-inner">
							<p>Minecraft Idle is a web based game that will require very little interaction from the user. The primary feature
								of an idle game is its strategy and how the user is able to maximise and plan ahead when leaving the game to run
								by itself. The game is currently still a WIP but if you wish to take a look at how the development of it is
								progressing, visit <a href="http://idle.anthonyjasper.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.idle.anthonyjasper.co.uk.</a></p>
							
							<img src="/images/mine-storage.png" alt="" srcset="">
							
							<h3>Colours</h3>
							<p>For this project, I needed to use a multitude of colours ranging across all the warm, cool and neutral colours.
								This was something far different from just picking 1-3 colours, now I have to work with 10+. I made this decision
								because I wanted to differentiate each of the skills and have the user associate a certain colour to a certain
								skill. In the image below, you will notice that I have used the colour green for the woodcutting skill. With the
								amount of skills there are, you can imagine the amount of colours that are being used throughout the design, which
								caused an issue when it came to some of the call to actions.</p>
							
							<img src="/images/mine-building.png" alt="" srcset="">
							
							<p>Example of one of these issues, which I plan on revisiting at a later date, are the buttons. In the image below,
								you can see that the buttons are a darker shade of yellow, on top of a lighter yellow with slight opacity. What
								makes it worse is the dark text being used. This is just poor accessibility and was an oversight when doing the
								design.</p>
							
							<img src="/images/mine-shop.png" alt="" srcset="">
							
							<h3>Typography</h3>
							<p>I have used two fonts across the design. The first for the skill and item names and the other for everything
								else. Since this is based on minecraft, I had to use a font that resembled the minecraft logo. The second, I
								wanted the font to be similar to the minecraft font but with better readability when used in large quantities. I
								was able to find the font "Hind" which ends most of its strokes with flat endings, helping create a clear-cut
								between the characters.</p>
							
							<img src="/images/mine-combined.png" alt="" srcset="">
							
							<h3>Design Patterns</h3>
							<p>The most prominent part of the site are the cards being used for the skills. They may vary in size and the
								content they contain but they still need to maintain the same shape, colours and shadows across each area to allow
								the user to know exactly what they are with minimum attention.</p>

						<h2>Decor Vanity</h2>
						<span>- - - - - - - - - - - -</span>
						<div class="design-inner">
							<p>Decor Vanity is an ecommerce website that will be focused on selling home decor for young childrens rooms. This can
							range from decorative letters for the walls or stuffed teddy bears with text. Using this colours also allows them to
							blend in with the more dominant white colour used throughout the design allowing the content to flow into each other.</p>
					
							<img src="/images/decor-hero.png" alt="" srcset="">
					
							<h3>Colours</h3>
							<p>Since this project is focused on decorative items and for a young audience, I decided to go with soft colours. I chose
							to go with a gradient of green and yellow to symbolise growth and youth which compliment each other well.</p>
					
							<img src="/images/decor-shop.png" alt="" srcset="">
					
							<h3>Typography</h3>
							<p>For the typography I kept everything as a single font throughout the site. I used a font that had good character spacing
							for all sizes and style of the font but also looked sharp and didn't have any trail offs at the end of each character.
							To allow the font to differentiate itself from itself and to create a hierarchy, I used a mixture of font size and
							bolded the titles.</p>
					
							<img src="/images/decor-menu.png" alt="" srcset="">
					
							<h3>Design Patterns</h3>
							<p>When it comes to an ecommerce design, there are many design patterns to focus on, so the one I wish to highlight upon is
							the product page. Here I have used large white container boxes to separate the focus points of the page. The first
							container purely focuses on the product and contains all the call to actions and information the majority of users care
							about when viewing a product. The second container contains the "secondary" information, which contains reviews for the
							product, product description and similar products.</p>
					
							<img src="/images/decor-product.png" alt="" srcset="">

					<div id="design-item3" class="designItem"> <!-- Ecommerce -->
						<h2>Ecommerce - Template</h2>
						<span>- - - - - - - - - - - -</span>
						<div class="design-inner">
							<p>This template for an ecommerce site was created as my first real test at designing something without any requirements
							from a client but as a more freeflow. I would take whats commonly seen on other ecommerce sites and put my own spin on
							them.</p>
					
							<img src="/images/comm-landing.png" alt="" srcset="">
					
							<h3>Colours</h3>
							<p>The primary colour for the site was a darker shade of green. I eventually turned it into a gradient ranging from shade
							to tint. I made this decision because I firstly like the look of these colours blending together but it also allows
							white to really stand out against it. It's also not too intrusive against the images that could be potentially shown
							alongside it. The secondary colour was more on the gold spectrum, this was used to highlight parts of the website that
							could be interacted with or require the users attention. For example the hours left on the sale items or redeeming some
							money off their next purchase.</p>
					
							<img src="/images/comm-featured.png" alt="" srcset="">
					
							<h3>Typography</h3>
							<p>The typography for this design is unfortunately not great in my opinion. At the time of doing the design I was creating
							text purely on how it looked, so there are multiple sizes, styles, weights and opacities being used, so it can get
							confusing when scanning a page.</p>
					
							<img src="/images/comm-product.png" alt="" srcset="">
					
							<h3>Design Patterns</h3>
							<p>The "Fat Footer". I went overboard on this section. There is no structure to this design pattern, making it look and
							feel very overwhelming for the user. If I was to revisit this design I would completely remove the shop navigation
							section. I would also move the satisfaction banner to the product page to give the user some confidence in the site and
							maybe have smaller logos of the delivery and payment system the site uses into the footer.</p>

					<div id="design-item4" class="designItem"> <!-- Game Showcase -->
						<h2>Game Showcase - Template</h2>
						<span>- - - - - - - - - - - -</span>
						<div class="design-inner">
							<p>For this template I wanted to create a design that focused on outer space. So using open space, dark theme with light
							accents and line/outline imagery to give it more of a sci-fi feeling.</p>
					
							<img src="/images/game-landing.png" alt="" srcset="">
					
							<h3>Colours</h3>
							<p>Due to the focus being in outer space, the majority of the colours are going to be neutral with some bright colours to
							draw attention to the call to actions as well as to create an exciting environment to showcase action within the game
							and cool points of interest to interact with. Light accents are used to create a sci-fi effect, as if the user is
							viewing it on a futuristic data pad but to also contain multiple sections on the page.</p>
					
							<img src="/images/game-intro.png" alt="" srcset="">
					
							<h3>Typography</h3>
							<p>For the typography, I used a font that had characters that stood out on their own and had a strong showing when
							capitalised. Not much text is being used throughout the design but the small amount that is, it needed to stand out
							against the background and imagery.</p>
					
							<img src="/images/game-features.png" alt="" srcset="">
					
							<h3>Design Patterns</h3>
							<p>The main design pattern here are the small grid galleries. They do need to be revisited due to all 3 having slight
							differences to them, but having the light accent border allows the images to have their own little space while giving it
							that "pop" to stand out amongst the others.</p>

					<div id="design-item5" class="designItem"> <!-- Art Shop -->
						<h2>Art Shop - Portfolio</h2>
						<span>- - - - - - - - - - - -</span>
						<div class="design-inner">
							<p>This design was made for a friend as a draft to see what a potential online presence would do for them. They wanted to
							be able to take commissions through the site as well as act as a shop and portfolio all in one for their art work.</p>
					
							<img src="/images/art-landing.png" alt="" srcset="">
					
							<h3>Colours</h3>
							<p>For the colours I wanted to be able to match the colours they used in their art. These colours were usually warm and
							cold pastel colours. The blue pastel colour was used at the primary due to it being used in large quantities and easy on
							the eye while scanned, and a more yellow pastel used at the secondary for hovers, actions etc.</p>
					
							<img src="/images/art-shop.png" alt="" srcset="">
					
							<h3>Typography</h3>
							<p>To match their art style I decided on using a decorative font style. I wanted something that looked like it was written
							with a fountain pen with a light artistry to it but kept to a more sophisticated principle.</p>
					
							<img src="/images/art-stalls.png" alt="" srcset="">
					
							<h3>Design Patterns</h3>
							<p>Image Cards. I needed to be able to display multiple images across the site for the portfolio section and the shop
							section. I used a whitebackground and placed a smaller image with a shadow behind it to make it pop out from the white
							background. The background also gives it a look of having a thick border separating it out from the others. To save on
							space, I used a hover on the cards to display other information about the image, such as tags, social media handles,
							title of the image and price.</p>

					<div id="design-item6" class="designItem"> <!-- Twitch Streamer -->
						<h2>Twitch Streamer - Portfolio</h2>
						<span>- - - - - - - - - - - -</span>
						<div class="design-inner">
							<p>This was my first ever attempt at creating some form of template. The aim of this template was to create something for a
							video game streamer on the popular streaming platform twitch. They could use this site to promote themselves even more
							and have a collection of all their content in one area. The main focus would be the stream and video content so not much
							will be done for colours and typography.
							</p>
					
							<img src="/images/twitch-landing.png" alt="" srcset="">
					
							<h3>Colours</h3>
							<p>There wasn't much focus on colours in this template. Neutral colours were used to make certain images / banners stand
							out more to the user but apart from that, there isn't much else to it.</p>
					
							<img src="/images/twitch-socials.png" alt="" srcset="">
					
							<h3>Typography</h3>
							<p>There was also not much focus on the typography, a basic font-style was used as well as the weight and colour of the
							fonts.</p>
					
							<img src="/images/twitch-stream.png" alt="" srcset="">
					
							<h3>Design Patterns</h3>
							<p>There weren't really any design patterns used throughout this design, due to not really familiarising myself within them
							at the point of this design. However the landing page has a full screen scale video playing in the background, which
							would play their recent youtube upload. This gives the user instant feedback as to what they can expect from this
							streamer.</p>

					<div id="design-item7" class="designItem"> <!-- Helene -->
						<h2>Helene Simpson Photography</h2>
						<span>www.helenesimpsonphotography.com</span>
						<div class="design-inner">
							<p>Helene Simpson Photography was a client's website that focused on selling photographs of newborns to create memories for
							the families as their child/children grow up. This was a website that needed to use a lot of imagery to capture the
							user's gaze and to make a purchase at the end of it.
							</p>
					
							<img src="/images/helene-hero.png" alt="" srcset="">
					
							<h3>Colours</h3>
							<p>When viewing some of the images the client sent me to be used within the site, the main colour within them was a soft
							pink. I used this colour to represent the accents throughout the site and stayed with white as the primary colour,
							allowing the pink to stand out and draw the most focus on the pages.</p>
					
							<img src="/images/helene-prices.png" alt="" srcset="">
					
							<h3>Typography</h3>
							<p>For the typography, I tried to find a typeface that matched the logo of the business, however due to this font being
							used in large quantities across the site, it couldn't be too decorative. I do not believe the font that was chosen was
							the correct choice, reviewing it after some time, it's not so easy to scan across the text and the letters seem to be
							slightly different from each other making you re-read a word from time to time.</p>
					
							<img src="/images/helene-pages.png" alt="" srcset="">
					
							<h3>Design Patterns</h3>
							<p>Gallery. The gallery was used to show a series of images showcasing multiple versions of photography for a certain
							topic. This allowed the user to see the different types of environments that could be provided for both genders and
							multiple ages. It includes manual next and previous navigation buttons as well as thumbnails that can be selected to
							change to whatever image they want to in the series. The gallery only changes to the important parts and does not reload
							the page.</p>

					<div id="design-item8" class="designItem"> <!-- Medway -->
						<h2>Medway Vegan Festivals</h2>
						<span>- - - - - - - - - - - -</span>
						<div class="design-inner">
							<p>Medway Vegan Festivals website was meant for a way for people to find out about local festivals and to organise stalls
							or book tickets to attend them. Production for this website stopped only a few days into the design phase because the
							client was unsure if they were able to manage the site alongside their other activities. In the images below you will
							see some low and high-fidelity mixed together.
							</p>
					
							<img src="/images/medway-landing.png" alt="" srcset="">
					
							<h3>Colours</h3>
							<p>For the colours I wanted to use something that was vibrant and matched the whole vegan theme of the website. The primary
							colour for the site was going to be green to show growth and it being the colour of nature. alongside the green I would
							then use red and yellow to highlight important parts of the site. During the early phase, you can tell this didn't work
							very well. The yellow contrast on top of the green wasn't working so well and when combined together for some of the
							backgrounds, it became too overpowering for any of the white text to have any sort of readability.</p>
					
							<img src="/images/medway-contact.png" alt="" srcset="">
					
							<h3>Typography</h3>
							<p>Two typefaces were chosen for the design, one being for purely the page titles and the other for the rest of the text.
							The title page font was chosen to relate to a more festive feeling, with some slight flare to the capitalised
							characters. This would've likely have been removed, due to having a whole typeface for just a title on each page is a
							waste of resources and could be easily achieved with the other typeface.</p>
					
							<img src="/images/medway-info.png" alt="" srcset="">
					
							<h3>Design Patterns</h3>
							<p>Cards. Cards were going to be used to display the different types of events. With the events displaying different images
							and content depending on their location, cards would have allowed the user to quickly browse for the information and
							showcase the varying events into small and digestible content.</p>

					<div id="design-item9" class="designItem"> <!-- Student -->
						<h2>Student Project</h2>

							<p>The purpose of this design was to help a student that was studying web design in college who asked me for some help. My
							aim was to show her how to separate out sections of the site, how colours are important to bring attention and how to
							get the user to view the site you intended them to.
							</p>
					
							<img src="/images/student-landing.png" alt="" srcset="">
					
							<h3>Colours</h3>
							<p>The colour orange was chosen to be the accent colour of the design because it is one of the colours used for the Indian
							flag. It is also probably one of the main colours that when talking about India, orange is most associated with. A grey
							colour was for the section backgrounds to resemble some of the architecture used within some of the images but it also
							allowed the contrast of the orange to stand out against it.</p>
					
							<img src="/images/student-sections.png" alt="" srcset="">
					
							<h3>Typography</h3>
							<p>A Serif font for the headings to go with the costumes and dance culture of India. A sans serif to be used for the rest
							of the text as well as a little of weight added to it to give it that strong bond between their families and language.
							It also helps with the contrast against the grey background and colourful pictures it's occasionally used with.</p>
					
							<img src="/images//student-typo.png" alt="" srcset="">
					
							<h3>Design Patterns</h3>
							<p>Gallery. Instead of using a single view, navigational gallery, a more grid layout gallery is used to bundle all of the
							content in a single viewing. This allows the gallery to display different sized images in a more condensed way, allowing
							for an easier time viewing them.</p>

							<h3>Colours</h3>
							<p>The colours were taken from their shop banner. Being a marigold type of colour, it makes the website feel less
							depressing, uplifts the users and offers hope. It's partnered with white, to keep with the flow of bright colours,
							however due to it being one of my early designs, I used the pure white colour which is a little too bright.</p>
					
							<img src="/images/sher-slideshow.png" alt="" srcset="">
					
							<h3>Typography</h3>
							<p>Not much attention was given to the typography in this design. A common serif font was used alongside increased font
							size, weight and style.

							images.
							</p>
					
							<img src="/images/pout-hero.png" alt="" srcset="">
					
							<h3>Colours</h3>
							<p>When thinking about what colours to use for a product that's advertised for women, pink will always be mentioned. It's
							associated with glamour, which is what this business is promoting and advertising towards its viewers. It was used
							alongside a light grey background, to allow the pink to have a contrast and point the users to the sections to want them
							to pay attention to.</p>
					
							<img src="/images/pout-cards.png" alt="" srcset="">
					
							<h3>Typography</h3>
							<p>Two serif fonts were used here, the body text got a basic style used, while the headers got a more stylised serif to fit

							<h3>Design Patterns</h3>
							<p>Accordion. The accordion was used to display a note to the user that couldn't fit onto the section without ruining the

							notice at the top of the section.</p>

							<img src="/images/shea-me.jpg" alt="" srcset="">
					
							<h3>Colours</h3>
							<p>There was no real plan on using colours to draw a user's focus or to create a contrast between different elements. I
							used colours to make the website "colourful" and look good, to make the site not so boring to surf. For example, for the
							product pages I used the colours of the physical products and applied that as a gradient to the backgrounds so it would
							match the image. This was later removed due to it being too much for the page and took away the focus from the important
							information.</p>
					
							<img src="/images/shea-product.png" alt="" srcset="">
					
							<h3>Typography</h3>
							<p>The typography used is just as chaotic as the colours used. One font was used throughout the website however, different
							styles, weights and sizes were used in multiple areas. I would say however, the positioning and readability of the text
							is good and if the user put a little effort ignoring the colours they could certainly find what they are after easily.

						<div class="design-inner">
							<p>Steam is something that I've used almost everyday for the last 8 years. since using it for that long, I thought it would be a good idea to put my skills to the test and redesign one of the main pages for it. The library page is where you access your list of games and start running them to play. My main aim was to try and use whats trending at the moment in web design and implement it into the new page design.</p>
							<img src="/images/steam-overview-rede.png" alt="" srcset="">
							<h3>Main Content</h3>
							<p>A lot of the content for the main content section is from Steams news section. The news section in my opionion is not viewed so much, however it displays certain information I believe to be important to the user, therefore should be moved up and displayed in the main area.</p>
							<p>I have tried to maintain Steams colours throughtout and using them to highlight certain key points. I have extended upon the friends who play section. In the Steams version, users have to hover over their friends profile images or sign-in and open another window for their friends list.</p>
							<img src="/images/steam-library-rede.png" alt="" srcset="">
							<h3>Games List</h3>
							<p>For the games list, I have kept most of it the same. It does the job it needs to do and does not require too much of the users attention. I have however, removed some of the features Steam uses in the list, such as filtering and display styles.</p>
							<img src="/images/steam-list-rede.png" alt="" srcset="">
							<h3>News Section</h3>
							<p>Removing some of the stuff displayed within the news section and moving them to the main section, allows for there to be more news articles to be displayed. At the moment, you may need to scroll for some time, depending on the amount of friends and achievements gained, to find what you're after.

							can be made to this.
							</p>
					
							<img src="/images/santa-landing.png" alt="" srcset="">
					
							<h3>Colours</h3>
							<p>When doing a Christmas themed design, it's almost set in stone to use blue, white, green, yellow and red colours.
							Following the 60-30-10 rule, I went with blue, white and green. The green is used for button elements as well as the
							images to create a festive feeling when using the app. The green also allows it to have contrast against the white and
							blue colours.</p>
					
							<img src="/images/santa-contact.png" alt="" srcset="">
					
							<h3>Typography</h3>
							<p>A generic and bland typography was used, with not much thought given to it. If I was to revisit it, I would choose a
							more festive typography for all of the font on the page. For example the "Mountains of Christmas” font on google fonts,
							this gives off a festive feeling as well as some users may feel some familiarity with the font since it looks similar to
							the fonts used in some christmas movies.
							</p>
					
							<img src="/images/santa-menu.png" alt="" srcset="">
					
							<h3>Design Patterns</h3>
							<p>Input fields. The app requires the user to input a lot of information about themselves as well as other people within
							their group. A mistake was done here and that was adding labels to the input fields. Due to the sheer amount of input
							fields required within the app and space, the labels take up too much valuable space which could have been achieved by
							just using the input fields with placeholder text. It also slows down the users scanning of the app and not drawing the
							attention to what I am trying to get the user to do.</p>
